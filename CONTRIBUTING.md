# Contributing

Thank you for being interested in contributing to the content of [joshbruce.com](https://joshbruce.com).

You don't need any specific knowledge or tools to get started.

## Content changes

For most content changes you don't need any special tools. You can open the `content` folder. The contents and structure will match the URL of the page you want to edit.

For example, if you want to edit the content found at:

https://joshbruce.com/software-development

You would go to the following file:

```bash
.
└── content/
	└── software-development/
		└── content.md
```

1. After clicking on the file, you should see the current contents on the screen. 
2. Click on the pencil to [edit the file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). 
3. Edit until you're satisfied.
4. At the bottom of the page, fill out the form by:
    - adding a title briefly describing the change,
	- optionally writing a longer description of the change,
	- select "create a new branch", and
	- click commit changes.
	
This will create a new pull request and notify me to review the proposed change. You'll get credited as a contributor to this project, however, Josh Bruce retains the copyright of the content per the terms of service.

If you don't feel comfortable updating the content yourself, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/joshbruce/content-joshbruce.com/issues). Or, if the comment isn't specific to content (your just want to chat), use the [discussions tab](https://github.com/joshbruce/content-joshbruce.com/discussions).
