These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a contract between you and Joshua Bruce. They govern your use of sites, services, products, and content ("Services") provided and maintained by Joshua Bruce. By using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to any of the Terms, you should not use the Services.

Joshua Bruce may change the Terms at his discretion. If a change is material, he will do his best to let you know before those changes take effect.

By using the Services on or after the effective date, you agree to the new Terms. 

## Content and services

Joshua Bruce reserves all rights in the look and feel of the Services. Some parts are licensed under third-party and other open source licenses. Further, some code is publicly available under various licenses.

As for other parts of the Services, you may not copy or adapt any portion of the code or visual design elements (including logos) without express written permission from Joshua Bruce unless otherwise permitted by law or made available in marketing materials.

You may not do, or try to do, the following:

- access or tamper with non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the systems of our technical providers;
- access or search the Services by any means other than the currently available, published interfaces (e.g., APIs) provided;
- forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or
- interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host, or network, including sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of content or accounts in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.

Crawling (not scraping) Services are allowed if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt files.

Joshua Bruce may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the Services, at any time, without notice.

## No children

The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. By using the Services, you affirm you are over 13 years of age. If we learn someone under 13 is using the Services, their account will be terminated.

Individuals aged 13 to 18 must provide written consent from their parent or legal guardian to take advantage of certain Services.

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability with any Service, please let Joshua Bruce know.

## Incorporated rules and policies

By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information as detailed in the Privacy Policy. If you are outside the United States, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of collected information (including your personal information and content) in and out of the United States.

## Privacy policy

### What we may collect

We may collect information about which pages you visit, information about the means used to access the Services (browser type, mobile or desktop for example); none of this information is tied to you as an individual.

Information you send us and referral information may be tied directly to you as a user. When you use the Services, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol address in accordance with our hostâ€™s anti-SPAM policies. We may use this information to fight spam and other abuses; to personalize Services; or to aggregate non-identifying information about how people use the Services.

### Disclosure of your information

As a rule, we do not share your personal information.

We will not sell your personal information.

We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a vendor or partner who meets our data protection standards; or (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.

If we're going to share your information in response to legal processes, we will attempt to give you advance notice so you can challenge it (for example, by seeking intervention from the courts), unless we're prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our Services we believe to be improper.

## Miscellaneous

**Disclaimer of warranty.** Joshua Bruce provides the Services to you as is. You use them at your own risk and discretion. That means they do not come with any warranty. None expressed, none implied. No implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title, or non-infringement.

**Limitation of Liability.** Joshua Bruce will not be liable to you for any damages that arise from your use of the Services. This includes if Services are hacked or become unavailable. This includes all types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.
No waiver. If Joshua Bruce does not exercise a particular right under these Terms, that does not waive the right to do so.

**Severability.** If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision that other provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect.

**Choice of law and jurisdiction.** These Terms are governed by Tennessee law, without reference to its conflict in laws provisions. You agree that any suit arising from the Services must take place in a court located in Nashville, Tennessee.

**Entire agreement.** These Terms (including any document incorporated by reference into them) are the whole agreement between Joshua Bruce and yourself concerning the Services.
