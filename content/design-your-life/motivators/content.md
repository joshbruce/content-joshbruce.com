If you haven't noticed I'm kinda big on values and principles as approach to automating decision making. When I first read Getting Things Done by David Allen I seem to recall feeling there was an idea that trying to identify values and principles was not seen as helpful while you're being overwhelmed; vacuuming while the house is on fire.

There's definitely something to that. Over the years, however, I cannot tell you how many times the outputs of various exercises has helped me with decision making. As simple as which jobs to pursue to whether or not I should be upset about the latest sociopolitical craziness.

The motivators exercise is inspired by Dan Pink's work from the book *Drive*, Gary Chapman with *The 5 Love Languages*, and some generation-based research.

There's a short version and an extended version. Let's start with the short. You take a list of motivators and sort them in priority order for yourself from most motivating to least motivating. Here are the motivators:

1. Mastery: Having a master-level understanding of the endeavors you pursue.
2. Autonomy: The freedom to choose your own adventure; how you work, when you work, what you work on, and so on.
3. Purpose: The reason or "why" behind things.
4. Connection: Relationships with others (*The 5 Love Languages*).
5. Process: The order and formal nature of things.
6. Sticks: Negative consequences for your actions.
7. Numbers: The facts and figures of things (includes money).
8. Prestige: The appreciation and recognition of others or a label that implies more responsibility or respect (office manager not secretary, custodial engineer not janitor, and so on).

Now, just put them in order. Here's mine as of this writing (I review it about once a year):

1. purpose,
2. autonomy,
3. mastery,
4. connection,
5. numbers,
6. process,
7. prestige, and
8. sticks.

Here's the thing, the order just ensures that one thing is greater than the other. If you want, you can lay them out linearly on a scale to show the distance. For example, my top four are pretty close to each other. "Sticks" though has a lot of distance between it and prestige; almost to the point of being able to say I'm anti-stick. You wanna threaten to hit me with a stick? I'll probably let you just out of spite; check out the movie Good Will Hunting when they're talking about abusive parents.

Anyway. Let's see what the expanded version looks like. Basically we're going to replace "connection" with each of the five love languages. My extended version looks like this:

1. purpose,
2. autonomy,
3. **physical touch (I'm big on hugs and high-fives)**, 
4. **words of affirmation**, 
5. **quality time**, 
6. mastery,
7. numbers,
8. **acts of service**,
9. **receiving gifts**,
10. process,
11. prestige, and
12. sticks.

From this exercise I can start to get a sense of some basic values: purpose and autonomy, for example. This self-knowledge can help me reflect on practices and tools I use; are they in keeping with these values?

I'm big on giving and receiving consent checks. That's in keeping with both purpose and autonomy as I need to explain my intent involving someone else (or myself) and the other person (or myself) has the freedom (autonomy) to decline or not participate.

With this combination, I am toying with the principle: Only participate in that which is consensual.

And this is how I find identifying your values, principles, practices (or habits), and tools goes. It's nonlinear. You don't need to figure out your life's purpose before determining your values before stating your principles and so on. Instead, you can start by cataloging your practices and asking yourself why that's a practice. 

This exercise is a way to get away from the writer's block that can often come from being asked to figure out what you want to be if you grow up.
