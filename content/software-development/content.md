Here's the thing: Since 1998 I've always said, "I'm not a software developer."

In that time many people have given me counter-arguments as to why I *am*, in fact, a software developer.

First and most obvious, I develop software applications and libraries. In the early two thousands I created what can only be described as a content management system in what is now [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash); I used it for my art portfolio to allow me to easily update the site. In 2005 I started building a content management system written in [PHP](https://www.php.net); this server-side web application eventually went on to run sites for multiple clients who paid me. Around 2011 I developed a time journal application for iOS. I've tinkered with, contributed to, and released various [open source products](https://github.com/8fold). And I continue to do so.

Second, I've been told that people appreciate my code and the approaches I take in development; the "you're good at it" argument. My general approach is to make software that is approachable. In other words, you don't really need to know a lot about writing code or computer science type things to jump in and start contributing to the code I write. I also think about things from an accessibility perspective, which means I don't assume someone has the latest technologies available to them or can interact with a computer in the same ways I can.

Third, I can "talk technical", pick up concepts quickly, and like talking with developers.

My arguments as to why I'm *not* a software developer:

1. It's not what I'm passionate about: I don't wake up in the morning excited about what new piece of code I get to write.
2. I don't work for an employer doing software development.

That's pretty much it.

The weird part is that every once in a while I get a wild hair where I think I want to embrace the label of software developer or I think I've come up with the next great app that solves some type of problem. I think I'll wait for that feeling to perpetuate longer than a year before I commit to calling myself a software developer though because, for the most part, I'm just a guy who creates tools to reduce how much time I spend working around a perceived problem.
