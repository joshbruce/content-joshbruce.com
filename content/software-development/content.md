I differentiate software development from [web development](/web-development) in the sense that all web development is software development but not all software development is web development. Web development is software development in a specific context, with contextual constraints.

I think I wrote my first line of code in the late [.ʼ80s](nineteen eighties)  using [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Did it again in the mid- to late-nineties; only this time it was animated and made sound. In 1998 I made my first website.

In the beginning I never said I was a developer; most times I still say I'm not. Back then I was strictly drag-and-drop.

Then my first paying client told me my [.HTML](hypertet markup language) sucked and they expected better for someone with my billing. (I never did get paid.) So, I started doing more with [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) via [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (which was Macromedia Flash at the time).

Flash gave way to database-driven websites using [.PHP](PHP: Hypertext preprocessor), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the [.MySQL](my sequential query language).

This is when I really started looking into object-oriented development.

I freelanced full-time for from 2007–2010. I did sites using WordPress, straight HTML and CSS, and even my own [.CMS](content management system). Around 2011 I decided to try my hand at developing an app for iOS.

So, I started learning [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and later [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)). I appreciated developing in both languages and in the Apple ecosystem in general. The app wasn't a viral success or anything, but the revenue it generated did pay for the annual developer license. Unfortunately, no one was asking for more features and no one was reporting any bugs and Apple took it off the App Store.

In their defense it hadn't seen an update in a pretty long time (years, plural). But, it still worked for me and I don't do updates for their own sake like some others seem to.

Now I work in [.IT](information technology) as an [Agile Coach](https://agilemanifesto.org) and [Scrum Master](https://scrumguides.org), which is pretty interesting considering I still tend to say I'm not a software developer and my college career was in fine arts, which sometimes felt like the distant cousin of the other liberal arts. (We build things instead of writing about thing, but our deliverables have roughly the same probability of becoming viable in the economic marketplace as philosophers and the like.)

So, all that to say, if you're looking for someone who fancies themselves a hacker extreme coder who knows everything from binary through Assembly to the moon, I'm not the guy. But, I've been around the block and I've seen some stuff, I guess.
