Upped the 401k amount to 20 percent; it seems like the change might take a paycheck before taking affect. Still waiting for the [.IRS](Internal Revenue Service); so, avoiding spending and not investing, which is a bummer considering the market was down significantly pretty much all of September and part of October.

I’m still cash heavy but spending cash is pretty easy; though I’ll most likely be investing most of that...once the IRS situation is cleared up.

We’re planning on moving in the beginning of 2022. The target area should be a little less expensive than where we are now.

And equities have started to bounce back.

## Health savings account

I sold my position at my other [.HSA](health savings account) provider. Now that is in cash as well.

Waiting for the transfer to the HSA provider I will be sticking with for the foreseeable future.
