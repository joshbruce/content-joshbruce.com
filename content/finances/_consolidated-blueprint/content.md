title: Consolidated financial blueprint

The strange thing for me is that I didn't look into financial advice outside what I knew until I was debt free. I remember calling the institution that had my Roth [.IRA](Individual Retirement Account) and asking about planning for retirement. The representative said, "Get out of debt, then start thinking about that and call me." Seemed fair enough at the time and that's what I did. Probably not the wisest decision.

We can't change the past, only determine how to progress into the future though, so, here we are.

This is a consolidation of the advice I found useful over the years to get out of debt and accidentally create wealth, such as mine is. In other words, this isn't a review of the different, individual strategies but a holistic view and attempt at integrating them.

With most of the strategies I've seen they are pretty generic and applicable to the most people. With that said, I think there would be benefit in adding nuance based on age range and what-if. The what-if being if I had made different choices.

## Infrastructure (basic)

This is about setup and constraints. 

At minimum you need someone willing to give you money, a place to put that money, and a way to take that money out and spend it.

Habit 1: Always redistribute (or earmark) income.

Stealing this one from teaching children about money. It's the three buckets: spend, save, give. You could have three literal buckets and if you get a dollar you would put a certain percentage into each of them. Maybe 50 cents in the spend bucket, 10 in the give bucket, and 40 in the save bucket. 

This takes that lump sum you received and divides it up into smaller portions.

If you're under the age of 18 in the [.US](United States) you most likely can't open your own bank account, you would need to ask an adult to open what's called a custodian account for you. I'm not sure if some banks allow it at younger ages and with what types of constraints. But, you want to get a savings account as early as possible to facilitate habit 2.

Habit 2: Maximize the amount of money making you more money; truly passive income.

In fact, you should probably go ahead and open two savings accounts. One is for the save bucket and the other is for the give bucket. Putting this money somewhere that's not readily accessible is helpful and, if you're under the age of 18, you likely can't qualify for a checking account. (Also, if you're under the age of 18 and reading this, see the Terms of Service.)

Let's shift to people over the age of 18; the same three buckets are a good starting place and it's advisable to add a couple more:

1. Income account (new): This is a checking account at a financial institution; this facilitates depositing money you receive from others and makes the bookkeeping easier. 
2. Save, Profit, or Hold (a name that implies you shouldn't spend this money): This is an interest-bearing account at a financial institution. 
3. Taxes (new): This is an interest-bearing account at a financial institution (a different sub-account than the Save account). As your money makes more money, the government might want to take a portion of that money; it's referred to as taxable interest-income â€” this is where you'll prepare for that moment.
4. Giving: This is an interest-bearing account. This is a set aside for charitable donations and even gifts for friends and family. 
5. Operating Expenses or Spend: This is a checking account and facilitates spending money. If you decide to get a debit card, this is the account to get the card associated with. 

Habit 3: Establish and maintain allocations and flows.

Here's what I'm using as of this writing:

1. All non-business income is deposited to the Income account. If you have a business and don't have a business account, I'd recommend opening a secondary sub-account specific to business revenue; helps with bookkeeping.
2. 10 percent goes to the Hold account.
3. 2 percent goes to the Taxes account. If you are self-employed, set this percentage to be the self-employment tax rate for your area and estimated revenue.
4. 0 percent goes to the Giving account.
5. 15 percent goes to the Operating Expenses account.

We'll talk about the other 73 percent with the "advanced" version. Your percentages will vary based on life circumstances. If you're in six-figures of debt like I was, you might need to drop to 1 percent to the Hold account, for example. If you're just starting out with this type of setup, you may want to start with 1 percent to the Hold account and everything else to the Operating Expenses account. As you see how money flows in and out of the Operating Expenses account you may find you can increase the percentage to the Hold account (or other accounts you open, more on that later).

Here's how money can flow between accounts:

1. The Income account can transfer to all other accounts at the same institution.
2. The Hold account can transfer to the Operating Expenses and Giving account.
3. The Taxes account can transfer to the Operating Expenses and Hold account.
4. The Giving account can transfer to the Operating Expenses account.
5. The Operating Expenses account can only transfer out of the institution.

Here are the events and under what circumstances these moves can be made:

1. When income comes into the Income account, the money is distributed as soon as possible to the other accounts.
2. On a regular basis, usually once a quarter, a percentage (not all) of the money available in the Hold account is transferred to the Operating Expenses account, the Giving account, or both.
3. On a regular basis, usually once a year, a percentage of the money available in the Taxes account is transferred to the Hold account. If you owe taxes, transfer that amount to the Operating Expenses account and pay the taxes. If you don't owe taxes, no worries. Regardless, subtract any deposits made for the current calendar year, and transfer all or a percentage to the Hold account.
4. When you want to give to a charity or give someone a gift, transfer that from the Giving account to the Operating Expenses account.
5. Whenever a bill is due or you need money, use the Operating Expenses account. If there's not enough money in the Operating Expenses account, draw from the Hold account. If there's not enough money in the Hold account, draw from the Giving account. Don't withdraw from the Taxes account beyond the aforementioned tax season transfer. And if you need to draw from other accounts, consider adjusting your percentages.

If you do nothing else, you'll be ready for what's coming and continuously preparing for the future. The nice part is that beyond the percentages all the other decisions can be automated because they've already been made.

Habit 5: Increase income (financial and emotional), reduce operating expenses, and leverage the gap.

## Practices

These practices can be worked simultaneously by adjusting the percentages to focus on some more than others. With that said, these are in a recommended order of prioritization.

Establish a minimum balance for your Hold account. Start at 1,000 USD (The Baby Steps: 1). Increase it to cover the maximum deductibles for all insurances (The Financial Order of Operations: 1); this could be on top of the 1,000 USD initially saved. When you take the redistributions discussed earlier, leave that amount in the Hold account.

If your employer offers a 401(k), contribute to it. If the minimum payments on debts and recurring bills (subscriptions, rent, and so on) are greater than 30 percent of your monthly net income, start with 100 USD per paycheck and work on reducing operating expenses. If the minimum payments are less than 30 percent of your monthly net income, increase your contribution up to your employer match or three percent of your gross income if your employer doesn't offer a match. (The Financial Order of Operations: 2).

Pay off high-interest debts. If you are under the age of 30, any debt with an interest rate greater than six percent. If you are under the age of 40, any debt with an interest rate greater than 5 percent. If you are under the age of 45, any debt with an interest rate greater than 4 percent. If you are over the age of 45, all debt. "Interest rate" includes emotional burden, which is a different type of interest (I paid my father back before my credit cards, for example). (The Financial Order of Operations: 3.) One approach is the snowball method (The Baby Steps: 2), which targets debts from the lowest to the highest balance; minimum payments to all, any extra money goes to the one with the lowest balance. Another approach is the debt avalanche, which tends to be more mathematically advantageous and may lack the psychological and emotional benefit of the debt snowball. I used a hybrid approach.

Build a runway of one to 12 months of baseline living expenses; you always have enough to cover the current month. This can become the new minimum balance of your Hold account. I don't call this an emergency fund because, for me, that implies it can't be used unless it's an absolute emergency semantics (The Financial Order of Operations: 4). The idea with this fund is that you can access the funds, with minimal penalty, within a few days. How long of a runway really depends on how reliable your income is. My day job is as a contractor and never know when I'll be laid off. When I was laid off in 2018 I had about six months in my runway, I drastically changed my lifestyle, and took unemployment while I wrote my book (I was also still in debt). Now that I'm out of debt and pretty secure in my job, I'm willing to temporarily shorten the runway to increase my investments.

Maximize tax-free contributions. In the US if an account type starts with "Roth," chances are you are contributing post-tax dollars, which then grow tax-free and you can withdraw from them without tax. For the Roth IRA, there's not many circumstances where it wouldn't be recommended. For the Roth IRA there are also income thresholds that could monkey with your plans (more on that later) and, as with all retirement accounts there's a maximum amount you can contribute each year. (Part of The Baby Steps: 4 and The Financial Order of Operations: 5.)

Maximize pre-tax, tax-free contributions. The [.HSA](Health Savings Account) in the US is an interesting account because your contributions to it will either be pre-tax (reduces your taxable income) or you can deduct the contributions at the end of the year (reduces your tax liability at the end of the year). Not only that, you can withdraw the funds tax-free for medical expenses and, after a certain age, for pretty much anything. Further, if you keep the receipts for medical expenses and pay out of pocket for the expense, you can withdraw those funds at any time, even if the money isn't used to pay for that specific expense. One decision to make here are whether you are willing and able to accept a high-deductible health plan, which may require increasing the amount in your Hold account reserved for insurance deductibles. Another decision to make here is whether you will take the HSA provider selected by your employer, or choose your own. If you choose the one from your employer you may be limited in what you can invest the funds into and other considerations; however, the contributions will most likely be taken out of your check pre-tax, which immediately reduces your taxable income. If you choose to go with your own provider, you may be able to find investments you appreciate; however, your payroll department may not make the contributions pre-tax on your behalf, which means you'll need to take a deduction during tax season. (Part of The Baby Steps: 4 and The Financial Order of Operations: 5.)

Maximize pre-tax contributions. At this point the water might be getting a bit more gray. Do you invest more in accounts that have age restrictions or not? If you're not looking to retire in the next 10 years, we're talking about your 401(k) and similar accounts. Start increasing the amount of your income that goes to these accounts. (Part of The Baby Steps: 4 and The Financial Order of Operations: 5.)

Increase investment contributions to 15â€“25 percent or more of your gross income (The Baby Steps: 4 and The Financial Order of Operations: 7). You won't be able to do more to your employer-sponsored plans and IRAs at this point, so, this will most likely be in some form of a taxable account. We're looking for investments that return roughly 5â€“7 percent per year.

Save for future known expenses and learning and growth. This could be for you or your children or both (The Baby Steps: 5 and The Financial Order of Operations: 8). Always make sure you're saving enough for retiring by 60; secure your mask before helping others.

Pay off low-interest debt. See the "Pay of debts" paragraph, regardless of age. (The Baby Steps: 6 and The Financial Order of Operations: 9.)

Increase giving.

## Infrastructure (advanced)

Wow, you're still here.

We're going to add to our five accounts and some percentages, these are the percentages I use when I receive income, not necessarily recommendations:

1. The Income account.
2. The Hold account; 13 percent.
3. The Taxes account; 2 percent.
4. The Giving account; 0 percent.
5. The Operating Expenses account; 15 percent.

The "advanced" part of infrastructure is to take further advantage of the concept of fund accounting by opening more sub-accounts to help facilitate the practices. 

For me, that means adding a few more accounts:

1. The Runway account: 10 percent. This is a money market account my primary financial institution and is for visualizing the runway amount you have and separating it from the Hold account balance.
2. The Invest Pass-through account: 60 percent. This is a checking account and is the account connected to my brokerages. That sounds so highbrow, like I'm some ultra-investor or something but it's because I have my preferred broker, which holds my main taxable account, my Traditional IRA, and my Roth IRA. They don't offer an HSA, so, I use a different company, which is the same company used by my current employer for my 401(k). Neither of them, to the best of my knowledge, have the ability to invest in the way platforms like M1 Finance do with partial shares and percentage-based portfolios with no commission fees. Anyway, the Invest Pass-through account allows me to continue keeping my Hold account separate from the money intended for investing.
3. The Equipment Pass-through account: 295 USD. This is an odd duck in comparison because it's not a percentage but a flat amount. I'm pretty dependent on technology to make a living. I want to make sure I can replace said technology on a regular basis; around five years. I have a set amount taken out of each of my paychecks and sent directly to another institution where I then transfer various amounts to certificates that allow continued deposits.

You might have one you start to set aside, and keep separate, money you're saving up for a cruise or some other trip.
