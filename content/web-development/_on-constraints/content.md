title: On constraints
---

This series was started on Medium. Some of the articles in that series are more about [software development](/software-development) in general and is why this series will represent those topics specific to web development, at least in my mind.

Granted, with how much we are depending on web-based [.APIs](Application Program Interfaces) these days, it seems almost all software development involves web development.

Anyway, the idea of constraints is liberating to some and a complete non-starter for others. For the former, constraints help overcome the blank canvas problem. For the latter, constraints are hinderances to the creative process and "discovering" the constraints and applying them ourselves.
